# Advent of code 2025 solutions

Here are the attempts of [HappyGnome](https://github.com/HappyGnome) to solve the puzzles for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025) 2025 by Eric Wastl.

Language used: Haskell

# Project structure
* `NextPuzzle.bat/NextPuzzle.ps1` Used to update the `cabal` and `Main.hs` files each day (run the `.bat`)
* `AdventOfCode2025.cabal` is the project cabal file - specifying lib dependencies, project modules and options 
* `app/Main.hs` is the entry point for the app (simply runs `exec` in today's challenge module)
* `app/Common` contains some implementations of common algorithms and helper methods the author has built up when working on similar problems
* `app/Puzzles/Input` contains a folder per challenge attempted, each containing input and test inputs
* `app/Puzzles/Parts` contains one Haskell file (module) per puzzle
